This tutorial equips to use async/await and the libraries built off of it. Here’s a recap of what is covered:

Asynchronous IO as a language-agnostic model and a way to effect concurrency by letting coroutines indirectly communicate with each other

The specifics of Python’s new async and await keywords, used to mark and define coroutines

asyncio, the Python package that provides the API to run and manage coroutines

Libraries That Work With async/await
From aio-libs:
aiohttp: Asynchronous HTTP client/server framework

aioredis: Async IO Redis support

aiopg: Async IO PostgreSQL support

aiomcache: Async IO memcached client

aiokafka: Async IO Kafka client

aiozmq: Async IO ZeroMQ support

aiojobs: Jobs scheduler for managing background tasks

async_lru: Simple LRU cache for async IO

From magicstack:
uvloop: Ultra fast async IO event loop
-asyncpg: (Also very fast) async IO PostgreSQL support

From other hosts:
trio: Friendlier asyncio intended to showcase a radically simpler design

aiofiles: Async file IO

asks: Async requests-like http library

asyncio-redis: Async IO Redis support

aioprocessing: Integrates multiprocessing module with asyncio

umongo: Async IO MongoDB client

unsync: Unsynchronize asyncio

aiostream: Like itertools, but async
